- From the beginning, I've devoted myself to FIRST robotics and it's ideals.

- I learnt team work through FLL, working with a small team and limited resources to reach the World Championship in St. Louis

- Through FTC I learned how to utilize my skills to solve engineering challenges, how to manage a team, and apply innovation and creativity in everything I do, regardless of the challenges and obstacles in my way as I experienced in FTC, working as a small private team out of my father's garage.

- At first, after joining Westview Robotics, I was daunted by the sheer size and scale of the robotics here, but I was eager to learn.

- I tried to apply my existing knowledge to better the team through my involvement in the Research and Development track.

- I researched material on my own to implement innovative algorithms such as Haar Classification, Depth Map, Analysis, and more.

- Always I asked the questions "How can I make this more efficient?" and "What can I do differently?"

- I was comfortable pushing my boundaries during competition season to tackle and master a design challenge that I wasn't experienced with, it ended up being one of the working components on the robot due to my persistence and dedication in designing and manufacturing this part.

- Near the end of the season I became more involved with the software track again, helping them implement innovative autonomous algorithms utilizing computer vision, finite state machines, and dual PID system utilizing multiple sensors.

- Before bag-n-tag I also applied an innovative technique to calculate the appropriate PID values of the robot using a measured step response. Saving valuable time before our robot was bagged.

- Through my experience with FLL mentoring this year, I was lucky enough to be able to mentor a youth FLL team in Deer Canyon, the same elementary school I went to.

- I will always treasure the time I had with them, and how I inspired the kids with the same values of FIRST which I grew up with.

Thank You.
