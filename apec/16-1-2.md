# Chapter 17.1-17.2
## Causes/Antecedents
- Humanism - Looking to ancients (classical civilizations) and realizing contradictions need proofs.
    - ***Natural philosophers***, or medieval philosophers moved from logical analysis to observation.
- Artists accurately depicted nature and humanity
- Scholar debate on influence of Magic/Hermeticism, into alchemy/the "Hermetic tradition"
## Background to Scientific Revolution
- Educated Europeans interested in nature as God's handiwork, but also were more liberated from it.
- Greek authors writings challenged Aristotle, etc. so they did too.
- Renaissance art influenced the sciences.
- Mathematics were the key to unlocking the sciences, mathematical reasoning was absolute.
- ***Hermeticism*** (Renaissance - god in everything) merged with alchemy, to fueled mathematical magic.
## Astronomy
- ***Ptolmaeic***, or geocentric conception,  prevailing idea from Ptolomy (2<sup>nd</sup> century AD) + Aristotle + Christian theology
- Nicholas Copernicus
    - Invented heliocentric theory, was initially attacked by Protestants. *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*
    - Protestant reformers were initially against it (esp. Luther), Catholic Church cool with it.
- Brahe
    - Brahe was a fancy Danish nobleman given an island near Copenhagen by King Frederick II. He built fancy Uraniborg Castle, where he collected a shit ton of astronomical observations for 20 years.
- Kepler
    - Brahe's assistant, a hermetic mathematician who came up with laws of planetary motion.
    - Elliptical orbits, equal area equal time, ![](http://bit.ly/2zwtWdW)
- Galileo Galilei
    - Inspired by Flemish lensgrinder's spyglass found sunspots, Jupiter's moons, phases of Venus, universe made of earthlike stuff.
    - Proved the heliocentric theory w/ a telescope and published these revelations in ***The Starry Messenger***
    - Condemned by the Inquisition, kept studying, and ultimately placed under house arrest.
    - Proved that a state of uniform motion is as natural as a state of rest. (Experiments for Inertia, Accelerationfrom Force)
- Newton
    - Normal kid until Cambridge closed for 18 months b/c of a Plague
        - Here he invented Calculus and started on the law of universal gravitation
    - ***Principia*** - Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
        - Explained universe in terms of mechanics
        - Three laws of motion
        - Explained how planets move in their orbits, explained others findings
        - *world machine* - world is like a clock
    - Newton influenced Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, Philosophy
