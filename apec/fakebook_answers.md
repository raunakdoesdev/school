### Émile Zola
Émile Zola's ideas of naturalism would appeal to Nietzche, as a staunch opposer of Christianity and spirtitual sciences as a whole. Nietzche would see Zola's writings and works, which embody the spirit of naturalism, that everything arises from natural properties of the world rather than from spiritual things as natural. This matches up with his philosophy of nihilism, where nothing matters or has much purpose in the world b/c it all just happened due to natural process rather than some divine gift of god. I'm sure he would've red all of Zola's novels and really appreciated the works for these reasons. He would likely also agree with her outlet of novel writing as Nietzche believes culture and the arts is a valid replacement for religion, as he famously proclaimed in his statement: "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?"

### Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
Lamarck is another such character which Nietzche would've gotten along with. He proposed ideas of evolutionary naturalism which falls in place with Nietzche's nihilistic viewpoint. Again, this philosophy denies the existence of any religious entity, again matching with Nietzche's views. The process of evolution as a naturall event, that occured with no regard or speciality for man, falls in place with his views as well.
## Dislike
### Millicent Fawcett
First of all, she is a women, and a feminist at that. Nietzche was known for repulsing women wherever he went due to his terribly large and disgusting looking mustache, and several contracted STDs (including syphylis) from a whorehouse in his time in college. Nietzche would see the women's attempt at leading feminist movements as unneccessary and meaningless. Instead he would suggest the women to find happiness and meaning within their cultural identity.
### Claude Monet
Monet was a famous impressionists, part of a group that saw beauty and meaning in every moment. This contrasts with Nietzche's perspective that nothing has meaning, that everything is meaningless. In fact, the two theories and ideologies are polar opposites. Nihilism is commonly associated with black nothingness whereas the paintings of Claude Monet are often colerful dotted with many different types of paint strokes, forming a hazy but beautiful picture of the meaning of the moment.
