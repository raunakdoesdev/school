## Science and Culture in an Age of Realism
### A New Age of Science
- Industrial tech -> Basic scientific research -> Practical tech improvements
- Steam engine -> thermodynamics, Pasteur's germ theory of disease, Dmitri Mendeleyev's periodic table, Michael Faraday's discovery of induction -> generator
- Increasing belief in science and secularization, growth of materialism, or the belief that everyting is a result of physical forces, evident in Darwin's theory of evolution.
### Charles Darwin and the Theory of Organic Evolution
- Studied untouched animals + plants on H.M.S. Beagle, proved natural selection in *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection*
#### The Theory of Evolution
- Plants animals evovled for long time from earlier simpler life (organic evolution)
- Wasn't applied to humans until later in *The Descent of Man*
- Seemed to eliminate purpose/design, but ppl began to accept it and apply it to society
### A Revolution in Health Care
- Nattural sceince in medicine led to breakthroughs w/ clinical observation and autopsies
#### Pasteur, Koch, and Germs
- Pasteur discovered germs (microorgs) caused disesase + fermentation in his experiments at the Ã‰cole Normale in
Paris (bacteriology)
- Examination of disease in wine industry -? pasteurization (heating to destroy germs) and vaccination against rabies which was extended to other diseases forming modern immunological science.
- Robert Koch cultured bacteria and stained microscope slides and identified specific bacterium for diseases (tuberculosis first)
