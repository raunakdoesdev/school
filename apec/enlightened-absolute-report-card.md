# Rank
| Monarch | Rank | Justification for rank including strengths and weaknesses of the monarch |
|---------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Joseph II of Austria | 1 | Joseph was truly enlightened. His policies were consistent with each of the tenants of an enlightened absolutist monarch. He had two flaws: one was that his reign was not effective. However, this was not the question. The question is "how well they embodied Enlightened Absolutism" not how effective the monarch was in their reign. His other flaw was that he was involved in war but this was true of all the supposed "enlightened" monarchs, and Joseph at least limited the extent to which he warred only getting involved on a surface level. Out of all the monarchs, Joseph clearly embodied the ideals of the period.
| Frederick II of Prussia | 2 | Frederick embodied most of the enlightenmint ideals, but most of the time he had exceptions to the rule. For ex. he advocated toleration YET he favored Protestantism. He funded education but only for the upper class, etc. Because of this although he generally embodies Enlightenment ideals he contradicts these ideas, especially in the case of war where he is a major general involved in several. |
| Catherine II of Russia | 3 | Man oh man, where to begin with Catherine. She is basically not an Enlightenment monarch except when it comes to spending her money. She really knows what to do with that stuff. For example, she is a great patron of the arts and funds education properly for all. However when it comes to things like religious policy and the basic rights of the working class, she comes up emptyhanded and usually sides with the nobles. For this reason she is the last place in this sorting.|
