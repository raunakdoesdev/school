## Chapter 29.3 - The Cold War: The Move to Détente
### The Second Vietnam War
- North was under Ho Chi Minh and Vietcong, and south under Diem -> US military coup in 1936
- Coup govt. terrible -> worry over domino theory -> troops deployed and bombings conducted -> De Gaulle's criticism of US involvement + protests
- Johnson escalated things, causing even more protests in 1966 + 1967
- Nixon reached agreement in 1973 to stop, Vietnam united, China + Soviets ruptured
### China and the Cold War
- Mao Zedong failed w/ Great Leap FOrward but now tried Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
- "Revolution" was basically Red Guard destroying everything old/non communist
- Nixon made friends w/ Mao, reduced tensions in Asia, even forming alliance against Soviets in 1979
### The Practice of Détente
- Antiballiistic Missle Treaty limited ABMs in 1972 and Helsinki Accords recognized new borders
- Reagan returned to cold war, boycotted the Soviet Olympics, aided anti-Soviets in Afghanistan, and was a proponent of the STrategic Defense Initiative (SDI = Star Wars)
