# Descartes Questions

1. What is the difference between rationalism and empiricism? Which do you side with?

Rationalism is the belief that religion/thoughts is the most reliable source of knowledge. Empiricism is the belief that sense and experience is the most reliable. I believe in empiricism as nothing is certain, but we can make assumptions based on our perceptions and make generalzations from this point forward. Religion cannot be proved and has no concrete evidence and thus cannot be accepted as the one tru reliable thought. That axiom has no concrete evidence of being true in our real life. We must start with some axioms and empiricism has the most realistic ones.

2. Do we really exist? How do we know?

According to Descartes, I think therefore I am. Which kind of but doesn't really make sense, what we can be sure of is that it doesn't really matter. If we don't exist we can keep living in the same way we are now, as that is a matter of what we percieve kind of.

3. How do Descartes and Locke relate to Plato + Aristotle?

Descartes believes in rationalism and Locke believes in empiricism. Rationalism is like idealism (Plato) where it is not real (ideal) while empiricism relates to realism and observation in the physical world (Aristotle).
