## A Divided Western World
### Stagnation in the Soviet Union
- Brezhnev Doctrine (opposite of Truman), more relaxed detente atmosphere
- A little more lax on art/sci but still strict, economy still heavy/beauracracy but didn’t bother trying to reform
- Andropov and Gorbachev wanted reform (young) -> gorbachev = new secretary (new era in 1985)
### Conformity in Eastern Europe
- Basic labor reforms enacted to appeal to the population
- Kedar in Hungary = communism w/ capitalist facelift
- Walesa's SOlidarity movement in Poland won concessions, until 1981 when Solidarity killed
#### The Prague Spring
- Novotony resigned in Czechoslovakia (Havel hate) -> Dubcek (Communism w/ a human face) + peace
- Red Army invaded, Husak replaced Dubcek, reestablished old order
### Repression in East Germany and Romania
- Stalinist policies remained, Berlin wall went up to prevent exodus of workers
- Ulbricht -> Erich Honecker used Stasi (police) for fear based rule
- Ceauşescu and Elena (wife) ruled romania using Securitate (police) for same
### Western Europe: The Winds of Change
- World wide inflation + unemployment, oil price increase in 1973, but recovery in 1980s
#### West Germany
- After miracle Adenauer era, Brandt (Social Democrat) opened to east w/ Ostpolitik (then resigned)
- Schmidt = technocrat (economic problem fixer w/ oil prices) and fixed deficit
- Free Democrats + Social Democrats divided again, Free joined Christian Democrats -> Helmut Kohl govt.
#### Great Britain: Thatcher and Thatcherism

- Socialists and Mitterland in power, tried centralization + decentralization failed
- Socialist policies failed, so went back to privatization, and he won second term in 1988
#### Confusion in Italy
- Andreotti fifth new PM, Italian Communists part of Eurocommunism (communism - Marxist ideology)
- After recession in 70s, former PM Moro kidnapped by Red Brigades (terrorist) + Mafia problems
- Gradual recovery in the 1980s but problems remained
#### The European Community
- European Economic Community expanded, led to cooperative efforts in a range of affairs (12 ppl)
### The United States: Turmoil and Tranquility
- Nixon had "law order" approach in South (slow desegregation) -> Watergate scandal (bugging Dem HQ)
- Economic problems under Gerald Ford + Jimmy Carter (stagiflation = inflation/unemployment)
- Carter faced stagiflation + hostage of Americans by Iranians (Khomeini)
