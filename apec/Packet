## Chapter 23.1 Notes - The Growth of Industrial Prosperity
### New Products
- Steel, chemicals, electricity vs. textiles, railroads, iron in second IR (Britain behind US + Germ)
#### Chemicals
- Brits behind, France + Germany changed soda for alkalies and Germans produced compounds (dyes + photographic plates)
#### Electricity
- Electricity = new form of energy via generators + public power stations
- Hydroelectric allowed for single power system per district
- Light bulb (Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan), Teleophone (Graham Bell), Radio Waves Transatlantic (Gugliemo Macroni)
- Countries used coal to enter the industrial age, and electricity transformed industries.
#### The Internal Combustion Engine
- First engines: gas + air, oil, Hamburg Amerika-Lane ocean liners
- Light engine (Gottlieb Daimler) was used in automobiles.
- Henry Ford mass production (trend)
- Wright Brothers made first flight in fixed wing plane w/ gas engine
### New Markets
- Foreign markets saturated (domestic markets reexamined)
- Population increase led to demand for consumer products (essencially was surplus of ppl and money)
- Mass marketing created department store etc.
#### Tariffs + Cartels
- Increased competition for foreign markets + demand for domestic markets (nationalism?)
- Protective tariffs made domestic markets for industries
- Cartels tried to decrease competition (controlled prices + ix production quotas)
#### Larger Factories
- Movement toward manufacturing plants b/c of competiotion + demands
- Rationalizing production by cutting costs w/ elictricity, tools, interchangable parts, assembly line, scientific management.
### New Patterns in an Industrial Economy
- Some fluctuation in markets characterized as depressions (especially agricultural)
- Time period still known as la belle epoque b/c of general economic boom etc.
#### German Industrial Leadership
- Germany leader of Europe in industry
- Britain already had plants, couldn't shift to new tech. British sus of new innov and reluc invest.
- German managers ready for change, new fields led to companies investing in lab equip esp. in Germany w/ technical schools (doctorate degrees)
#### European Economic Zones
- Some parts advanced some old (Austria, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Russia) = still agricultural (economic division)
- Agric price drop ->, Brit + Germ machines for threshing + harvesting, specialization in one food (Denmark butter)
- Chemical fertalizers used by large estates but not small ones.
- Sucked for farmers but good for working class (other foods more abundant than bread)
#### The Spread of Industrialization
- Japan built infrastructure, universal education system (science), key industries developed from farm workers but still shit conditions.
#### A World Economy
- Marine transport, railroads allowed for world trade + economy, Europe dominated world economy.
### Women and Work: New Job Opportunities
- Working class (women shouldn't work), but they did so anyway w/ "Sweating" (individual pieces at home) + "slop work" was really cheap goods.
#### White Collar Jobs
- Shortage of workers, increased demand, allowed women in white collar jobs (secretaries, teachers,nures)
- Couldn't go anywhere b/c low skill jobs and low literacy rates. Jobs escape from "dirty" lower class.
- Industrial jobs -> white collar jobs for women, not increase in working women as a whole.
#### Prostitution
- Rural working class girls in cities had only one alternative when faced w/ unemployment. Active from late teens through early twenties.
- Govt. regulated, authorities examined for disease, "shrieking sisters" led by Josephine Butler opposed these Contaigious Diseases Acts b/c only punished women.
### Organizing the Working Class
- Unions = mutual aid societies, but conditions led to ppl making parties + unions off of Marx
#### Socialist Parties
- Marxist Leaders: Wilhelm Liebknecht + August Bebel, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) competed in elections (improved work conditions), and grew despite govt. opposition, eventually largest party in Germany.
- French socialist leader: Jean Jaures (looked to French Rev. more than Marx) similar in every country. Marxist Social Democratic Labor Party in Russia (1898)
- Leaders of diff parties joined to make Second International, which made May Day (international labor day) but differences wreaked havoc at their conferences b/c of revisionism and nationalism.
#### Evolutionary Socialism/Revisionism
- Led by Eduard Bernstein, rather than capitalism breaking down, the mid class was actually expanding, and revolution by democratic channels would get socialism.
#### The Problem of Nationalism
- Second International passed resolutions for joint action but nothing, socialist parties became tied to their individual countries. Nation > class/socialism esp. in World War I
#### The Role of Trade Unions
- Unions won the right to strike, necessary for workers' goals. Walkouts (female ind ex.) -> unions 
- Didn't develop in the Continent as in Britain, tied to socialism France's General Confederation of Labor was weak and ineffective b/c of decentralization.
- German unions also political, largest = socialists, all of which bargained w/ employers collectively. They forgot revolution for smaller reforms, and improved conditions.
#### The Anarchist Alternative
- Lack of fervor + Marxist Socialism -> Anarchism = ppl corrupted by society (common in non developed) true freedom through abolishing state.
- Initially non radical but Russian Michael Bakunin believed small groups of revolutionaries could be so voilent that the state would dissentegrate.
- After Bakunin died, revolutionaries assasinated as main method of terror victms = Russian tsar, president of French Rep., King of Italy, President of the United States
## The Emergence of a Mass Society 23.2
### Population Growth
- After 1880, decline in death rates -> increase in population driven by medical discoveries + environmental conditions.
- Smallpox vaccines and improvements in urban environment reduced fatalities from disease
- Agricultural productivity + food hygeine (milk pasteur) -> < infant death 
### Emigration
- Rural ppls migrated to industrial regions (Poles -> Germany, Italian -> France)
- Industrialized areas couldn't take this many people so ppl went to North America a lot more
- Persecuted minorities (Jews, Poles, etc.) from Hungary emigrated, applied to most countries.
### Transformation of the Urban Environment

### Nationalism
- Nation states led to competition + rivalries expanded b/c of expansion led to allaince between Germany, Austria, Italy vs. France Britain, Prussia

- Britain declared War on August 4 b/c of Belgian neutrality violation, but actually because they didn't want Germany + AUstria to win the war.
## The War
### 1914-1915: Illusions and Stalemate
- Enthusiasm for war in 1914, nationalism overrided socialism, and ppl filled armies
- Illusion of short war from past wars and belief nation's economy destroyed after short time at war

- Others were more self interested (David Lloyd George wanted Britain to pay for the war)
- Geroges Clemenceau wanted to demilitarize Germany and German land as revenge (Rhineland buffer)
- Moves against Russia to stop spread of Bolshevik revolution + Italy didn't matter at all
