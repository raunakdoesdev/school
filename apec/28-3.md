## 28.3 - Recovery and Renewal in Europe
### The Soviet Union: From Stalin to Khruschchev

#### Stalin's Policies
- Thermonuclear weapons + Sputnik developed, heavy industry grew 3x, Stalin increased repression and political terror
#### Kruschev's Rule
- Stalin died in 1953
- de-Stalinization and tried for light industry and consumer goods (not good for Soviet economy)
- Foreign failures (Berlin and Cuba) make him unpopular, resigned b/c of mental issues
- Brezhnev takes over but is another hard line Communist
### Eastern Europe: Behind the Iron Curtain
- All satellites under Soviet control remain so
- Gottwald becomes president of Czech
#### Albania and Yugoslavia
- Tito in Yugoslavia tried making his own communist state, more decentralized
- 1948-53, satellites -> Stalinization
#### Upheaval in Western Europe
- Polish Gomulka makes his own state, which Soviets fine w/ if follow Warsaw Pact
- Hungarians try this too w/ Nagy as new leader and Kadar takes over and crushes rebellion
### Western Europe: THe REvival of Democracy + Economy
- Not much success for communists outside of France/Italy
- Communists + Social Democrats hurt socialist image
- Moderate political parties make a comback (Christian Democrats weren't religious)
- Marshall Plan gave the West a quick comeback
#### France: The Domination of de Gaulle
- Charles de Gaulle takes over again (he's the one from ALgerian wars)
- Tries to make France a great power, pulls from NATO, and joins nuclear arms race
- Fails to nationalize industries, but doesn't work, student protests occur, he resigns in 1969
#### West Germany: A Reconceived Nation
- New parties form, Federal Republic of Germany is new thing
- Adenauer pulls economy back together, new currency, wages doubled, guest workers from other nations used (HE IS A MIRACLE)
    - wants better relatiosn w/ France, finance minister Erhard takes over and begins to address Nazis in Nuremberg trials
- Economic downturn in 1969 leads to Social Democrats taking over
#### Great Britain: The Welfare State
- Labour Party + Attlee take over after Churchill's Conservatives and promise reform
- Britain utilizes the welfare model w/ National Insurance?Health Care/ social security/ socialized medicine
- Labor unions demand for higher wages but they don't match in productivity
- Britain loses status as a world pwoer
#### Italy: Weak Coalition Government
- Christian Democrats are good, they take ovewr in 1948 under Gasperi, keep voters happy
- Government starts taking over more industry and succeeds in nationalization
- Unfortunately, North richer than south and socioeconomic divisions exist
### Western Europe: The Move toward Unity
- After NATO, Europeans still desire unity, European Coal and Steel Community becomes common market for materials
- European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) negotiates nuclear peace and collaborates
- Same six sign Rome Treaty -> European Economic Community (EEC)/Common Market makes free trade and no internal (only external) tariffs, all involved benefit.
