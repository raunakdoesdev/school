# Chapter 16.3-16.4
## Advances in Medicine and Chemistry
- ***"Humoral theory"*** of medieval medicine
    - Comes from 2<sup>nd</sup> century Greek physician ***Galen*** who's physiology explained next to cadaver dissection.
    - illness came from imbalance of natural humors in the body(blood, yellow bile, phlegm, black bile)
    - "Contraries cure" opposites create a balance
- ***Paracelsus***
    - Arrogant, changed his name to mean "Greater than Celsus" (a famous ancient physician), he couldn't keep a job (city physician and professor of medicine at Basel)
    - Humans are small replicas of the larger world, disease treated with chemicals like chemical reactions in larger world.
    - "like cures like" (poison used to cure poison) dosage emphasized, father of modern medicine, but he is also mainly holistic.
- ***Andreas Vesailus***
    - Wrote *On the Fabric of the Human Body*
    - Suggested practical research to understand anatomy, rectified Galen's errors, but didn't get blood.
- ***William Harvey***
    - Layed the foundation for modern physiology by describing motion of blood and heart, completely wrecking Galenic theories.
- Robert Boyle and Antoine Lavoisier (Chemistry)
    - Boyle's law (first gas law) --> ![](http://bit.ly/2yt4lF6), and found chemical elements.
	- Lavoisier created names + list of elements which his wife Marie-Anne translated. Discovered hydrogen + oxygen
## Women
- Position of Women for Science
	- In England/France mostly informally trained upper class
	- Germany had family craft production, so women got to be scientists(esp. astronomers + entomologists) [1/7 astronomers women]
	- ***Querelles des Femmes***, centuries long arguments about women and their role
	- Science of the period "proved" women were inferior, though this was science finding what it wants to.
		- Vesalius used small skull and wide pelvis to show male mind superior, women = childbearers (complete BS)
		- Midwives got kicked out, only serving low classes.
		- Distribution of books continued these ideas, ***Jean de La Bruy√®re***
- ***Margaret Cavendish***
	- Scientific critic who criticized attempts to master nature.
	- Participated in debates, but was excluded from Royal Society membership.
	- Was an aristocrat (good example of French + England women scientists)
- ***Maria Sibylla Merian***
	- illustrator/entomologist who described insects of the Dutch colony of Surinam in South America
	- Wrote  *Metaphosis of the Insects of Surinam*, cycles of insects
- ***Maria Winkelmann***
	- wife of Germany's foremost astronomer, she discovered a comet.
	- Corresponded with Leibniz and when husband died was not let into Berlin Academy (obstacles of women)
	- No women ever invited to Berlin Academy, Royal Society of England, or French Academy of Sciences until the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
