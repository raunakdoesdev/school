## 30.4: Toward a Global Civilization: New Challenges and Hopes
- Multiculturalism in art → awareness of environment, technology, and reminder of globalization
- Global economy is an effect of globalization
1. The Global Economy
	- International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides economic aid to developing countries and oversees global finances, 188 members
	- Multinational/transnational corporation like Siemens, GE, Exxon Mobil, etc (companies with divisions internationally), dominate industry and capital (can be labeled as “corporate globalization”)
	- Free trade is another factor in economic globalization
	- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) → World Trade Organization (WTO), helps arranges free trade agreements and disputes, but may disregard environmental/health concerns (larger socioeconomic gaps)
	- International trade has been facilitated after relaxation of trade barriers
	a) The End of Excess
		- 2007 financial crises (US housing market collapse) → selling of CDOs and added instability to investment risks → bankruptcy
		- Bc of globalized economy, financial distress spread quickly like fire, IMF supplied rescure packages
		- Greek economic crisis destroyed economy with debt larger than budget, agreed to strict measures in return for help from EU → social unrest
		- Still recovering from crisis, leads to decisions on greater political unity or chaos?
2. Globalization and the Environmental Crisis
	- Gulf of Mexico oil spill (2010) and other events making people aware of environmental concerns
	- Population growth is a concern (12.8 bn by 2050?)
	- Global warming due to greenhouse effect and mass extinctions
3. The Social Challenges of Globalization
	- Migrations have occurred for political/civil unrest reasons, creating social backlash
	- Gap between developed and developing nations may be increasing, explosive population growth and civil war in developing countries adds to this by creating food shortages (Sudan and Darfur famines)
4. New Global Movements and New Hopes
	- Emergence of NGOs and other grassroots social movements for various civil rights, environmentalism, technology use, peace movements, etc. — “think globally, act locally”
	- Often represented at UN and by other corporate and public organizations
	- Political, ethnic, and religious disputes, pollution/business disputes, and other sources of conflict like widening socioeconomic gaps threaten economic, political and social stability
	- Even as globalization occurs, the world is also being further divided along ethnic/religious etc lines
	- Lessons: lack of involvement in society → sense of powerlessness
