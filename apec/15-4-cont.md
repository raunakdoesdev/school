### Responses to Revolution
- Hobbes claimed humans were animals only controlled by commonwealth in a sovereign authority.
- John Locke argued against singleperson rule in *Two Treatises of Government*. Humans were in a state of equality and freedom where humans had inalienable natural rights to life, liberty, and prosperty.
- Government's job was to protect these rights, and people had right to form new government if rights were broken. Locke's ideas were importaint for American and French enlightenment.
