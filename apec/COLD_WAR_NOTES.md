- Global economy is an effect of globalization
1. The Global Economy
	- International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides economic aid to developing countries and oversees global finances, 188 members
	- Multinational/transnational corporation like Siemens, GE, Exxon Mobil, etc (companies with divisions internationally), dominate industry and capital (can be labeled as “corporate globalization”)
	- Free trade is another factor in economic globalization
	- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) → World Trade Organization (WTO), helps arranges free trade agreements and disputes, but may disregard environmental/health concerns (larger socioeconomic gaps)
	- International trade has been facilitated after relaxation of trade barriers
	a) The End of Excess
		- 2007 financial crises (US housing market collapse) → selling of CDOs and added instability to investment risks → bankruptcy
		- Bc of globalized economy, financial distress spread quickly like fire, IMF supplied rescure packages
		- Greek economic crisis destroyed economy with debt larger than budget, agreed to strict measures in return for help from EU → social unrest
		- Still recovering from crisis, leads to decisions on greater political unity or chaos?
2. Globalization and the Environmental Crisis
	- Gulf of Mexico oil spill (2010) and other events making people aware of environmental concerns
	- Population growth is a concern (12.8 bn by 2050?)
	- Global warming due to greenhouse effect and mass extinctions

4. New Global Movements and New Hopes
	- Emergence of NGOs and other grassroots social movements for various civil rights, environmentalism, technology use, peace movements, etc. — “think globally, act locally”
	- Often represented at UN and by other corporate and public organizations
	- Political, ethnic, and religious disputes, pollution/business disputes, and other sources of conflict like widening socioeconomic gaps threaten economic, political and social stability
	- Even as globalization occurs, the world is also being further divided along ethnic/religious etc lines
	- Lessons: lack of involvement in society → sense of powerlessness
