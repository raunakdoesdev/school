## Aftermath of hte War
- WW2 super destructive and increased struggles of the daily ppl, and their way of life
### The Costs of World War II
- Soviet Union had most losses, millions faced starvation, civilian deaths quite great
- Millions of "displaced persons" (Germans kicked out of Sudetendland/Western Poland, Koreans/Japs)
### The Allied War Conferences
- Cold War occured after allied victory, stemming from differences made clear in War Conferences
#### The Conference at Tehran
- Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill had met in Tehran to decide course of the war
- Decided on American-British invasion of the Continent through France
    - This meant Eastern Europe would be liberated by Soviet forces, questions over Poland were disregard.
#### The Yalta Conference
- By the time of conference, German defeat guaranteed, but now Westerners worried about Red Army soldiers taking control of so much of Europe.
- Soviet Union wanted alliance with West but called for spheres of influence rather than Roosevelts self-determination
- Grand Alliance approved Declaration on Liberated Europe (pledge to allow for self determination)
- Roosevelt got Soviet help against Japan, and agreed to Stalin's possession of Sakhalin, Kurile Islands, and two Manchurian ports.
- United Nations was created at Yalta which both Churchill and Stalin accepted (first meeting in SF 1945)
- Big Three reaffirmed Germany's unconditional surrender and created four occupation zones
    - French zone carved out of British and American zones
- Provisional govt. established in Poland, with both Lublin (communist) Poles + London Poles (non Communist)
- Stalin agreed to free elections to determine new govt., but were pro-Soviet (a big failure)
#### Intensifying Differences
- Western relations with the Soviets detoriated rapidly, after Nazi scapegoat dissapeared disagreements made apparent
- From Soviet perspectivee US termination of Lend-Lease aid before termination of war and rejection of 6 billion dollar loan request
- Soviets rejected "Declaration on Liberated Europe" by making a coup in Romania under Communist Petra Groza (Little Stalin)
- Soviets sabatoged London Poles and installed Lublin Poles in power, which seemed like a power grab to US
#### The Potsdam Conference
- After Roosevelt's death, Truman demanded free elections in Europe which Stalin denied
### Emergence of the Cold War
- Soviet fears legitament, they saw the West as untrustworthy and uncaring
- When James Byrnes proposed 25 year disarmament of Germany, Soviet Union rejected it
- Byrnes announced American troops would be needed in Europe and setup for independent West Germ., Soviets saw this as threat to Europe
- Westerners saw Soviet policy as worldwide Communist conspiracy, Soviets saw West as economic imperialists
- Iron Curtain divided Western/Eastern Europe dividing Europe into two hostile camps
