## The Emergence of a Mass Society
### Population Growth
- After 1880, decline in death rates -> increase in population driven by medical discoveries + environmental conditions.
- Smallpox vaccines and improvements in urban environment reduced fatalities from disease
- Agricultural productivity + food hygeine (milk pasteur) -> < infant death 
### Emigration
- Rural ppls migrated to industrial regions (Poles -> Germany, Italian -> France)
- Industrialized areas couldn't take this many people so ppl went to North America a lot more
- Persecuted minorities (Jews, Poles, etc.) from Hungary emigrated, applied to most countries.
### Transformation of the Urban Environment
- Industrialization -> Urbanization (cities grew faster than rural b/c of migration and improving conditions)
#### Improving Living Conditions
- In 1840s: Edwin Chadwick (Britain) + Rudolf Virchow and Solomon Neumann (Germany) identified sanitation as cause of disease.
- Legeslation passed (The Public Health Act of 1875, Britain) for building inspectors, mandatory drainage, better housing.
- Sewage systems established w/ dams/resevoirs, aqueducts, tunnels -> less cholera/typhoid, private baths
- 1860s Frankfurt Germany first w/ sewage system, some places polluted rivers, but water def better
- Public parks created to combat air pollution, green space in London (Victoria Park) + Paris
#### Housing Needs
- Good housing neccessary for a stable family + society  said V.A. Huber - German Housing Reformer
- Construction of model houses at good price would make others elevate housing standards (Octavia Hill did this)
- As cities grew, govts collected taxes for cheap housing for working class (laissez faire failed in housing) as in other areas.
#### Redesigning the Cities
- Defense Walls torn down replaced w/ parks + boulevards (allowed rapid troop deployment) + good view (Ringtrasse - Vienna)
- Paris reconstructed under Napoleon III (wide boulevards, new buildings of recreation/middle class)
- Suburbs introduced for the displaced (commuter trains allowed) separated home + work
### Social Structure of the Mass Society

- Aristocrats + Plutocrats fused b/c plutocrats bought land to enjoy country side.
- Educated elite became involved ingovt beuracracy and military hierarchy (marriage joined groups)
#### The Middle Classes
- Contained law, medicine, civil service, merchants (addition of buisness managers, and new professions)
- Professional associations formed as symbols of this importance, and low middle class = shopkeepers, traders, manufacturers.
- White collar workers between lower middle class + lower class (bank tellers, secreatries, etc.)
- Regular churchgoers, taught values of progress and science, concerned w/ propiety, habits, etc.
#### The Lower Classes

- Universal male/female attributes, women didn't do much, except in low classes where it was neccessary.
#### Marriage and DOmesticity
- women couldn't earn living (no more covenants) -> more domestic servants + legitament/honorable marriages
#### Birthrates and Birth Control

- Dr. Aletta Jacob first birth control clinic to stop poor babies but rich ppl used more
#### The Middle Class Family

- Sons sent to schoools, used sport to toughen, activities centered about character + military, evident in Boy Scouts.
- Most organizations were for middle class not working class
- Usually one servant, so women had to help them while still maintaining fascade of idleness for husband.
#### Working Class Family
- Women did piecework to help the family (women worked) childhood ended by 9/10
