### Old Regime
- Clergy, Nobility, Everyone Else (97%)
- Clergy + Nobility was Tax Exempt
- French cucked financially b/c of the French Revolution
    - Public resentment b/c most money used in Versailes, army, debt
- Nobility getting their power back from times of Louis XIV
- Louis VI called Assembly of Notables (asking them if can tax, failure) "what sauce cooked?"
- Louis VI must call The Estates General
### The Estates General (1789)
- Disasterous b/c outdated where each estate passed one vote (first two outvoted third)
    - Didn't take into account Bourgeoisie or French Professional Class
- Abbe Sieyes wrote "What is the Third Estate?" Are Everything, Were Nothing, Want Something.
    - Not completely radical, just wanted double votes, and vote by head
    - Louis XVI granted double votes but not vote by head (indecisive)
- Hat Fiasco (sumptuary laws)
    - Louis: Hat off, Clergy Hat off, Nobility Hat off, pause, 3rd est hat off, pause, Louis: Hat on
    - Estates General collapses
### The National Assembly
- Third Estate form their own "National Assembly" declared as representing France.
    - Few clergy + nobility join, but most are left in the Estates General and there's confusion.
    - Louis tries to shut them down by locking the door of the National Assembly room
        - No problem, National Assembly goes to a "Tennis Court" and swore not to adjourn until adopting a constiution for France (wanted to create a Constitutional monarchy)
    - Louis finally recognizes the National Assembly and tells all the estates to join them.
- Louis secretly also brings troops to Versailles (building distrust)
    - They find out about this in Paris
    - Marquis de Sade (crazy pervert) kept in the Bastille (mini prison) he shouts out "They're killing the prisoners"
        - People think they are political prisoners, and storm the Bastille ***(July 14, 1789) Bastille Day***
- Grain shortage in the French Countryside, the people thing this is part of some Aristocratic plot and the "Great Fear" (peasant revolt) commences
    - National Assembly responds w/ ***Decrees of August 4th*** 
        - Abolish the Feudal system, Noble's Hunting Rights, and Tax Exemptions
### Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen
- Outlines a plan for principles of Constiutional Government based on natural rights (citizenship)
- Written by National Assembly (***ask Mr. Wood for more info***)
### Civil Constitution of the Clergy
- Before Civil Constitution of the Clergy
    - National Assembly confiscated Church property in 1789 + abolished religious orders in 1790 and mandatory tithes
        - Church is at the mercy of the State
- Purpose of civil constiution was to make the Church a part of the state (liberate vs. regulate)
    - Bishops elected, Oaths of allegiance to state, Standard pay scales for bishops, Attendance Policy, Bishops need to seek permission before leaving their areas
    - Assignats issued as collateral for church property
- Was a transitional step between the liberal revolution of 1789 and radical revolution of 1793
### Transition/Opposition
- Peasants pissed at Civil COnstitution of Clergy and Jacobin Clubs form and join the Parisian club
- Louis XVI tried to flee to Austria (captured at Varennes) but failed.
