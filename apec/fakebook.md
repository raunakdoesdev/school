What's on your mind?
- How silly my eyes are. I spend hours imagining the audacity of these ocular organs at night. Why? Why do I have eyes? To see. Then again why must I see? To live, to carry out my life in a fullfilling manner. But again, why? This final question, has no answer. We live, we die. There is no why.
