## The Peace Settlement
### Peace Aims
- Woodrow Wilson submitted Fourteen Points for lasting peace + self-determiniation of ppls and against absolutism + militarism.
- Others were more self interested (David Lloyd George wanted Britain to pay for the war)
- Geroges Clemenceau wanted to demilitarize Germany and German land as revenge (Rhineland buffer)
- Moves against Russia to stop spread of Bolshevik revolution + Italy didn't matter at all
- League of Nations created and Wilson allowed compromise, Clemenceau got British + French alliance rather than neutral Rhineland
### The Treaty of Versailles
- Final and most important peace settlement, was harsh although Brest-Litovsk w/ Russia was even worse.
- Reparations were mandated by Germany, but left amount up in the air
- Germany had to cut it's military, lose Alsace Lorraine to France, and parts of Prussia to Poland.
### The Other Peace Treaties
- Other treaties redrew map of Eastern Europe, Germans and Russians lost a lot of territory
- Austro-Hungary divided up, Romania got Russian land, Hungary, Bulgaria Serbia got Yugoslavia.
- East European states compromised and each state had a minorities problem
- Arab states were promised independence but Britain stole Iraw Palestine France took Lebanon + Syria
- League of Nations + self-determination was good organizing principle but ppl were short sighted
- US never ratified Treaty of Versailles and never joined League of Nations to limit future war
- Britiain left alone increasing French opposition to Germany and creating resentment.
