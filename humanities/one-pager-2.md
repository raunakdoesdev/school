#### Creativity and imagniation are tools for fullfillment, and are fundamental human rights.
- In Frank Gehry's Bilbao he rejects defined symmetry on all axis of the building, as if the design was randomly executed, and places each room at a different height and size. By employing these techniques of hierarchy and assymetry Gehry exemplifies the nature of creatvity, never repeating the same thing twice, and having a completely unique design in each facet of the building. Though there exists a seemingly random architecture, Gehry places the central focal point of the museum, in the atrium, making the building resemble a lotus from above. The lotus has forever been a symbol of purity, as the flowers blossom floating above muddy waters. Gehry tries to show us that true fullfillment and englightenment can come from chaotic creatvity.

#### Humans should further society through their incredible potential.
- The Copenhagan International School's design is covered with solar panels. By C.F. Moller Architects. The use of solar panels throughout the design aims to provide a sense of duty for the students of the school. By choosing this particular architecture for a school, the goal becomes to teach the next generation to care for their community and environment, rather than the individualistic views of the past. The goal shifts from the betterment of the individual, to the betterment of future society.
    
#### No one should be forced into a single guiding philosophy or creed, as a whole through the views of the entire human race, society can be bettered.
- Kohei Nawa's PixCell-Deer#24 mirrors the traditional Shinto religious painting, a Kasuga Deer Mandala, but through his glass beads which distort and reflect light and the space around the deer, invites the viewer into the painting, bending the perception of reality and expectations, and challenging the single view of the world. The glass beads are meant to represent the biological cell of an animal, and at the same time be a pixel or the smallet unit of visualization in graphics. By depicting the crossroads of religion, science, and technology, in one sculpture, Nawa shows how through the integration of seperate individual's ideas one can further society to create something beautiful.
