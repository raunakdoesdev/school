# Differences between Baroque and Renaissance
## Baroque
- ACTIVATION of High Renaissance.
- Dynamism/Instability
- Interrelated archhing diagonals (energy/movement)
- Involving/close, real not idealized.
- Interrupted contours
- contrast in light and dark (deep shadow)
- directed focus and relationship between subject.
## Renaissance
- serenity, eternal, stability, horizontals, verticals, calm nobility, more reserved distant, idealized, uninterrupted contours, 
# Bernini - David
- Observing the human body, understands naturalistic Renaissance, but is focusing on emotional intensity in a moment in time.
- Tension/drama in face is unleashed, depicts the moment of action.
- Activates the space around the stone, emotionally and bodily involved in the work.
- Crossing many times, forming a knit brow intense concentration, can feel that he is gathering ALL of his strength.
- Council of Trent affirmed use of art to teach faith (more seductive)
### Carvaggio - Crucifixtion of St. Peter
- Close feet in cross (moving into space (Foreshortening))
- Instability of lifting the cross, diagonals of the cross and the back and butt of the people.
- Sharp contrasts between light and shadow, creating vivid energy.
- Emotional involvement in the body, center of gravity moved up. Opposite of Renaissance stabilitiy.
### Vermeer - Woman with a Water Pitcher
- Everthing is quiet and has a subtlety., instability in transition, caught moment in time, light is almost coming into the room (entering), subtle transition from pitcher to the window. Closeness to the table.
- Clouds cast shadows that create alternating fields across the field.
# St. Peter's Square - St. Peter's Basilica's Piazza by Bernini
- Complex geometry, moving away from just circles and square. Bernini activated the Church, moving into the space around the Church.
- Reaches out into the city, wings reach out of the Church and obelisk. Longitudinal access incorporates architecture.
- Massive columns (Tuscan) in four rows keeps the piazza simple and focuses attention, brings attention to multiple colors of Basillica.
# Bernini - Ecstasy of Saint Teresa
- Installation piece, using all means to involve viewer into inspring faith in the miraculous.
- Physical body used for sexual Symbolism, St. Theresa's spirtual visions through means of metaphor.
- Shows intense revlation and the physical and the spiritual making her moan.
- Expresses direct relationship between this relationship, involving the viewer in the relief sculptures (in theater audience) we become part of the art.
- Marble almost moves opens up to show us the 
- Window hidden behind the sculpture to bring light into the sculpture "making us feel in our bodies"
# Carvaggio - Calling of St. Matthew
- St. Peter in front of Peter on the right, behind him is Christ facing us. He is kind of delicate and removes him from the regular world. Peter heavy.
- Matthew is a tax collector along with, moment of enlightenment kind of.
- The MOMENT of transformation, he is shady and bad.
- Sense that the money has not been gotten legally, greedy turns to enlightenment.
    - Christ walking into door of Banana republic.
- Chris sends piercing rays to Matthew, but is still immersed in his reality. Manipulation of light shows enlightenment spreading from Christ to Matthew.
- Window covered to block window dirty, grimy.
- Christ's hand is Adam's, Christ redeems Adams sins just as Matthew was recreated.
# Reuben's The Rape of the Body of Lecippeus
- Men are Castor + Pollux, are taking away these people to be raped.
- Amazing amount of twisting, and movement, but there is a complete balance amongst everything, but there is panic inside.
- Bursting out of the canvas, movement. Constructed from two interlocking diagonals.
- Relates the bodies (thigh to arm), bent horse leg is the same as the body's bent leg, and bent head of man on bent horse.
- Negative space forces apart the women's bodies, flesh tones are very detailed, translusency of flesh (falling out of the picture)
# Vermeer - Woman with a Water Pitcher
- Idealized, domestic life depicted. Would be purchased by the wealthy. Love of the every day, beauty of what is around us.
- Beautiful and delicate, but we see valued items of the table cloth and the elippse of the basin.
- More real than reality, brass nails in the chair behind, shows us what we don't see in the image.
- Modeling for the audience (sensuality of space)
# Gentileschi, Judith and Holefernes
- Dark manner creating shallow face in front of us.
- Moment of action (killing the king), intense emotion.
- Diagonal going through the head and bag as well as the left diagonal.
- Blood is spurting everywhere, there is tension and imbalance between the bodies. Struggles on the right, you can feel the force it took.
- His fist is the size of the women's face, fully extended arms of women, but the bent arms of the General is making the body kind of severed.
- Foreshortening, blood and gore close to us. Lots of contrast in light and dark, roling up the sleeves in naturalism.
# Rembrandt - Self Portraits
- Social distance is eliminated in Rembrandt's work. Foreground space in other paintings.
- In Rembrandt's work he is sitting close to the watcher. He finds every imperfection and wrinkle, emphasizing the life he lived.
- Intorspective look and face, layering of thick paint on face. Light to dark and light again. Muscles and slight shifts in architecture. Contrast between face and background where there are less brush strokes. Coloration (Blues, Reds, Greens, Greys, Whites) in Rembrand'ts face. Can feel the hand moving across the surface.



# ISMs
- Humanism - Idealism, Secularism
- Baroque - Naturalism
    - Drama, Diagonals, Foreshortening
    - Dynamism - movement, caught in the moment
    - Mysticism (orders were kind of focused on miracles and stuff) St. Theresa (don't use that word use spiritualism)
    - Every day settings, holy scenes more normalized.
