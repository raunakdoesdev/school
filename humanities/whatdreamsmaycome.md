What does it mean to be human?
How does it relate to the modern era?


- Analyze the paintings themselves
- Moment waking up in new orld is significant
- Technicolor paint
- Two main colors (Red + Blue/Violet + White)

- Red is a very big color here, along with white.
- Tripping down the wedding aisle is seen as bad luck maybe
- Red splotch in corner when walking down the aisle.
- Blue/Violet seems to be a very prominent color as well.
- Very obvioustime passing as the blue vehicle fades away
- Fade outs and into white
- Color is incredibly importanthere, white + purple shirt is specially symbolic
- Complete white in Christie's world, it almost sees it. She stands on a staircase of black.
- Very black red confusing darkness when he gets run over
- Rainbow is present
- Specific POV shot is very important as she stares forward without acknowledging him.

1. "When I was young, I met this beautiful girl by a lake"

2. Red scarf/cloth
- Love?, Foreshadowing death via blood, etc.
- Flows away, wind almost begins to carry it away and it's significant.
3. "When death claims the life of our children, we are left w/ too many questions. How do we make sense of the feelings we have?"
- Extraordinary paradise/
4. Painting on wall that child draws on - man walking on water

5. "Paintings are the most important, interesting thing in the whole world, next to your brain."
- They are an expression of what cannot be expressed essentially other than your own thoughts. The whole point of language and communication.
6. White hospital room + voiceover
- Seems like God right? The doctor is essentially God. 
7. Blurred figure that guides Chris
- A black dancing man, he is the one who remains unseen.
8. "Dreams don't deal in time, doc. Time doesn't count."
- Time is irrelevant in that world.
9. "If I were dead, would I need you to tell me?" ... "I'm the one you don't wanttosee. You don't want to bedead."
- 
11. He only died? Is that just about the fac tat there is a life after death?
12. Dying tree amidst the jungle and magical, the human figures are morphing betweenthe paintings, the dream house 
- Blurry figure is Annie (not visible)
13. Tree is dying?
14. Art is a way for loving him.
15. He still exists, he exists
16. Painting of blurred figures in the foreground, we don't know our selves, we are afraid of
17. blue purple colors = sorrow sadness, it's part of his realization
18. When he goes away he fades, runs through a tunnel into the light, black against white with figures in the background.
19. Things seem blurry at first glance, he is in the real life impressionist painting, buut all together everything is beautiful. The world reduces to this paint and it's beautiful. Real paint is the dream, the thoughts become synchronized with imagniation. He lives inside this impressionist painting, yet he is alone next to the bare willow tree.

- "This is real" - the man in the garden is is real
- The momories themselves are real, the experiences facilitate the memory, but are not what is real and substantial. Only the memories themselves are real.
- GREEN = being lost going away
- the house is there
- Final fades to white go to the past, he is drowning in the water
- Wearing a purple tie in the end after he drowned. Matches with blue suit of Christie?
- Sometimes when you lose you win
- He tried everything nothing worked until joining.
- Opening repeats itself the second time in the movie
- Meets her in the lake again, that's p cool
