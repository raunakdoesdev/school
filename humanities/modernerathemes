- Superficial happiness
- Anonymity
- Impersonal feelings
- Lack of stability
- Science leading to progress leads to problems (innovation/technology) = we are becoming more and more anonymous
- Uncertainty in the future


Due to the streamlined(not right word) world, there is no longer a need for interpersonal relations,  (no creaitivity/no thinking, you don't have a stake in the world, so then you're miserable))

Because of feelings of superficial happiness and absolute order which serve to disguise the unertainties and absurbidities of the world, 
- There is a sense of order = everything is going as it's supposed to be, since that is so impersonal, no one has any individual sense of themselves, everyone struggles to be themselves.
- Lack of identity is a result of fearing the confrontation of fears.

Loss of religion(result of the modern era) acts as a moral compass to follow, w/o moral compass lose morality, ppl commit atrocities, people become lost
Happiness can only be obtained if you abandon structure/order.


Uncertainty in the future leads humans to play safe, and seek structure, yet this leads to unhappiness as different individuals cannot all be reduced to one structure due to human's inherent individuality. (First half is good apparently)

Superficiality of the happiness they seek leaves them unable to accomplish the

Dissatisfaction w/ life = superficial happiness, so we lose happiness
Superficial happiness is escape from the world, need to escape is caused from a lack of order/control.

- Humans find stability w/ time
- Hugo acts like God, 
- Humans are controlled by time


What is the so what? Empathy, Acknowledgement of Someone, Leads to SuccessG

- Do people have to shed their feeble virtues to succeed in life, or do they need something else to overcome them, or do they not need to overcome them at all b/c they are diff than what Nietzche claimed
