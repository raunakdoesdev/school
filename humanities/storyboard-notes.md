# Storyboard Music
## Beethoven - Symphony #5
- Rising up with crescendo and decrescendo, and then good finally triumphs over evil in the nightmarish battle that was described.
- Nightmarish battle with victory
## Beethoven - Ode to Joy
- Dark Landscape, striving for happiness. Dreaming about what good can come, and drifting into this dream from a dark and desolate landscape.
- Dreaming of eroticism, feminism, and happiness that can be achieved.
## Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata
- Idyllic scene of a lake at night, with the moon reflecting on it. Couple sitting together dreaming about their future, falling into a sort of trance.
## Chopin - Impromptu #4
- Feelings/self-expression, self-analysis
- Moment of confusion -> clarity, dramatic moment of understanding/realization (can be used as a climax?)
## Symphony No. 6
- Pathetic, nightmarish, nationalism (betrayal of country almost)
## Piano Concerto #1
- Feelings and self-expression, inner self coming out, self analysis
## Ride of the Valkyries - Wagner
- Nightmarish scene of battle in mind. Patrioism for their country. Preparing for battle, getting ready to defeat the enemy.
## Piano Concerto #2 Rachmaninov
- Bells of Moscow, Romantic Yearning (Eroticism)
## Also Sprach Zarathustra - Strauss
- Space Odyssey, Patriotism, dramatic, similar to Ride of the Valkyries is a good preparing for battle.
## 1rst Peer Gynt Suites - Grieg
- Definitely very very Rococo thinking about the idylic scene of morning.
## 2nd Peer Gynt suite - Grieg
- Impending disaster, playful tension, can be used as for an expositional conflict (not somehting extremely dramatic but more to introduce characters)
