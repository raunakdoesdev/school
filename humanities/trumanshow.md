- He's not satisfied with his limited life (Fiji = heaven), we are constantly thinking of what is beyond.
- Money, planning, etc. needed for heaven (penance, etc.) but it's futile because Fiji can't exist, it's unnatainable, it's a lie told to him by his surroundings.

- He layers the women to try to make his beloved, it's difficult.
- He didn't buy a amagazine on one day, he has free-will.

- He is constantly framed behind windows/ mirrors, etc.
- He is becoming suspicious about his own reality, a brooding but happy music is playing signifying the arrival of something new
- He sees the set this is important, the people don't care. He feels trapped ina little boxy town.

- And the last thing I would ever do is lie to you, but like every statement is a lie.

- Camera is always still when Truman speaks
- Close up is used only for infomercial type things (when wife is talking)
- He was in competition with several other pregnancies
- We accept the reality of the world in which we're presented (important)
- He has shielded him from the "realities of the world" = "Seahaven" (ignorance, etc.), if you are determined to discover the truth (nihilism/existentialism) then you will find it.
- THe main guy is acting as a parent, protecting Truman from the realities of the world
- Truman acts like a child because that's the state he is in essentially.
- When he is more and more trapped the lens gets more and more constrained + dark. When he acts crazily/knows the truth he begins to see.
- People are being "fed lines" by society
- The light looking for him is a bright spotlight like the moon in a sea of darkness. (Light and dark used very efficiently.)
- THe lights on the flashlights are probably significant of this as well.
- Characters completely change when he becomes like this
- Every day looks exactly the same, they all get into "first positions"
- Eagle is shown on the front, against the water. = freedom

- He is batterred by stroms as the black eye comes back (he is getting farther and farther away, the black eye morphs into a black circular one.
- SUre enough the eye comes back when he 
- He is like Christ with the cross, depicted as the savior, the martyr, etc.
- Clouds and sunlight appear, and the camera becomes white again. But this is importaint.
- Seahaven is constructed with white, blue skies, blue waters, etc. = everythign we associate with good, whereas the outside world is represented in a black door (falsehoods)
- He moves toward the black in a sea of all that is good, as the music takes a major key and everyone stands watching.
- He is appreciating the dream for the last time, and sails into the end o
- He finally sees the truth and his happy but not truely, the wall is lined with darkness and seams (reality is not perfect, beautiful, or consistent)
- His shadow is cast behind him, as the eye comes back as he takes the steps upward towards the door. Although he is in "heaven" he takes steps up to escape reality.
- Black door cast against the blue sky (the dirty reality against the blue/white backdrop)
- There is no more truth in the messy existential world that exists, than in the false world he has.
- He is put up agains the dark void with his head down
