- Tried to talk to Shu Lien in the bamboo setting behind them, she didn't say anything and she didn't want to be responsible for that, so she didn't give in either, it's not until he's dying that they both give into that emotion.
- Jen and Lo always had that, but Jen wanted to be part of the Wudon, and Shu Lien convinced her not to be, Jen's choice in the end was to Wudon, she let go of Lo and choise Wudon, so she wouldn't have to go through the pain of loss?, why would she choose wudon and that faith over her love for Lo?

Ironically when she witnesses true love she comes to realization about emotion and what it does and how it can destroy several relationships etc.

- There are many crouching tigers/hidden dragon are in both
- Crouching tiger (modern) -> to dragon (postmodernism)
- Tiger is full of life and embodies the drive to make progress, Dragon is a symbol of imperial power
- Jen initially is dragon (has potential/talent) hasn't utilized it and let go of things and gain the stability of a crouching tiger
- At the end she transforms that power into fullfillment/satisfaction
